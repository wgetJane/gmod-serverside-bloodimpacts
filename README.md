## server-side blood impact effects for gmod

this addon stops client-side prediction of blood splatter particles + decals when shooting other players

instead, blood effects will only be seen by the client when the server has confirmed that they've successfully hit their target

why? because this should prevent players from complaining about "fake hits" or "shitreg"

this addon does not affect hit registration at all, but it should make hitreg feel better and less frustrating (placebo effect)
